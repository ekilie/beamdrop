# Features to make Beamdrop production-ready and professional:

## 1. Authentication and Authorization:
*   **Robust Authentication:** Implement a more secure authentication system beyond a simple password flag (e.g., user accounts, multi-factor authentication).
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles and permissions for different users (e.g., admin, read-only, read-write) to control access to files and operations.
*   **External Authentication Integration:** Support OAuth2, OpenID Connect, or other identity providers.
*   **Granular Permissions:** Allow setting permissions on individual files or folders.

## 2. Security Enhancements:
*   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS and ensure all traffic is encrypted.
*   **Comprehensive Input Validation:** Strengthen validation for all user inputs (file paths, filenames, search queries) to prevent path traversal, injection attacks, and other vulnerabilities.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and resource exhaustion.
*   **Secure Error Handling:** Ensure error messages do not leak sensitive server or file system information.
*   **File Type Restrictions for Uploads:** Allow administrators to configure allowed file types for uploads to prevent malicious content.
*   **Directory Listing Protection:** Ensure that raw directory listings are never exposed directly to users.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP for the frontend to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Security Headers:** Add appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options).

## 3. Robustness and Scalability:
*   **Improved Error Handling:** Implement consistent, detailed, and user-friendly error handling across all API endpoints and the frontend.
*   **Concurrent File Operations:** Ensure thread-safe handling of file operations to prevent data corruption under concurrent access.
*   **Optimized Large File Handling:** Implement streaming or chunking for efficient upload and download of very large files.
*   **Advanced Database Management:**
    *   Migrate to a more robust database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) if SQLite proves insufficient for scale.
    *   Implement proper ORM or database migration tools.
    *   Optimize database queries.
*   **Externalized Configuration:** Move all configurable parameters (shared directory, ports, database connection strings, security settings) to environment variables or a dedicated configuration file.
*   **Health Checks and Monitoring:** Implement API endpoints for health checks and integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

## 4. Enhanced User Experience (Frontend):
*   **Advanced File Browser UI:**
    *   Drag-and-drop functionality for uploads and file movements.
    *   Progress indicators for uploads and downloads.
    *   Multi-file selection and batch operations.
    *   Thumbnail previews for images and videos.
    *   Improved file/folder sorting and filtering.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensure optimal viewing and interaction across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Enhanced Search Functionality:**
    *   Filter search results by file type, date modified, size.
    *   Full-text content search (if feasible and performant).
*   **Starred Files Integration:** Fully implement the backend and frontend for starring/favoriting files.
*   **User Notifications:** Provide clear feedback for successful operations, errors, and background processes.
*   **Theming/Customization:** Allow users to customize the appearance.

## 5. Deployment and Operations:
*   **Containerization (Docker):** Provide Dockerfiles and instructions for easy packaging and deployment.
*   **Orchestration Support:** Document or provide configurations for deployment with Kubernetes or similar tools.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up automated testing, building, and deployment workflows.
*   **Centralized Logging:** Integrate with centralized logging solutions (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk).
*   **Backup and Restore Procedures:** Document or implement mechanisms for backing up and restoring data.

## 6. New Core Features:
*   **File Deletion:** Implement API endpoint and frontend functionality for deleting files and folders.
*   **Shareable Links:** Generate unique, shareable links for files/folders with optional password protection and expiry dates.
*   **File Versioning:** Basic version control for files, allowing users to revert to previous versions.
*   **Trash/Recycle Bin:** A temporary holding area for deleted files, allowing recovery.
*   **User Management Interface:** For multi-user deployments, an admin interface to manage users, roles, and permissions.
*   **Webhooks/Event Notifications:** Allow external systems to be notified of file changes (e.g., new upload).
*   **API Documentation:** Provide comprehensive API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).
*   **Folder Upload:** Allow uploading entire folders.

## 7. Interactive & Engagement Features:
*   **Enhanced Media Playback:**
    *   In-browser video and audio streaming with advanced controls (playlists, speed control, picture-in-picture).
    *   Image gallery with slideshow, zoom, and basic editing (rotate, crop).
*   **Real-time Collaboration (Optional, depending on scope):**
    *   Shared folders with real-time updates for multiple users.
    *   Commenting and annotation features on files.
*   **Personalization:**
    *   Customizable themes, layouts, and display options for the user interface.
    *   User profiles with avatars and personal settings.
*   **In-App Notifications:**
    *   Real-time notifications for file changes, new uploads, shared content, and system alerts.
*   **Integrations:**
    *   Ability to integrate with other cloud storage providers or productivity tools (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, Slack).
*   **Advanced Visual Search/Filtering:**
    *   More intuitive and visual interfaces for searching and filtering files, possibly with tag clouds or faceted search.
*   **Activity Feed/Timeline:**
    *   A chronological feed of recent file activities within the shared directory (e.g., who uploaded what, when, and where).
*   **File Previews:**
    *   Rich previews for various document types (PDF, Office documents) directly in the browser.
